# Overview

The package **SGPmatrices** contains baseline coefficient matrices derived from SGP analyses of large scale state assessment data. The baseline matrices are utilized by functions within the SGP package to calculate baseline SGPs as well as baseline referenced projections. The package is under active
development by staff at the [Center for Assessment](https://www.nciea.org).

The baseline coefficient matrices embedded in **SGPmatrices** are updated periodically. Current contents include:

* AZ_Baseline_Matrices: Contains 2021 baseline matrices for Arizona AzM2.
